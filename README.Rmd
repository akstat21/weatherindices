The goal of weatherindices is to facilitate the calculation of Weather Indices for crop yield modeling.

## Installation

You can install the development version of weatherindices from [GitHub](https://github.com/akstat21/weatherindices) 

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("akstat21/weatherindices")
```

## Example

To calculate weather indices you require weekly weather data and yearly yield data. Both the data should be separate variables. The number of data points in weather variable should be multiple of numbers of years of yield data and number of weeks considered in each year.

```{r example}
library(weatherindices)
data(Burdwanweather) #Weekly weather data for the rice growing season in Burdwan
data(Burdwanriceyield) #Yearly Yield data of rice  in Burdwan
wwi.maxtem<-wwi(Burdwanriceyield$burdwan,Burdwanweather$Max.Temperature)
wwi.maxtem
```
